        <p>
          <img class="profile-picture" src="profile-pic.JPG" /> I’m a
          software engineer for Cognizant Technology Solutions and have been
          coding professionaly for the past 3 years.
        </p>

        <p>
          My technical interests revolve around Application Development and
          Cloud Infrastructure. More broadly, I’m interested in Cars, Culinary
          Arts, and usually question what can make the world a better place.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I’m not building things, I train as a boxer, experiment with
          cooking, go on walks throughout Brooklyn and listen to tunes ranging
          from Urban Desi to Hip Hop.

<p>
  I’ve spent significant time building out my own full stack applications. It’s
  one of the ways I keep up to date with my skills and expand my knowledge of web development 
  beyond the scope of my professional work.
